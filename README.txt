# Water Treatment Plant Model
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Model was developed to support the Stage 1 & 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts rules passed in the 1990s and 2000s.

This version of the WTP Model is *not* and official release by the US EPA and is intended exclusively for educational purposes. The estimates derived from the WTP Model will not necessarily be applicable to individual raw water quality and treatment effects on a site-specific basis. This model does not replace sound engineering judgment for an individual application.

## Background
The WTP Model was developed to estimate the following treatment parameters:
- Basic inorganic parameters (pH, alkalinity, hardness) as affected by chemical addition
- Natural organic matter (NOM) removal/changes as affected by treatment
- Disinfectant decay based upon applied doses, demands exerted by NOM and inorganic material, water detention times and temperatures, and treatment processes
- Inactivation of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and viruses based upon the predicted values of the above-noted parameters as well as water detention times and temperatures, treatment basin baffling characteristics, and USEPA-published CT tables
- Disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation based upon water detention times/temperatures and the predicted values of the above-noted parameters within the treatment plant and the distribution system

## System requirements
This version of the WTP Model is **only compatible with Windows computers**. Sorry Mac users! :cry:

## Downloading the program
![Download ZIP](./Images/download-zip.png)

To download the WTP Model, click on the ```Clone or download``` button in the top right corner of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/wraseman/WTP-Model-CU-Boulder) and then choose ```Download ZIP```.

## Running the program
To run the WTP Model, first unzip the ```WTP-Model-CU-Boulder``` folder from the GitHub page. Next, check that "wtp_v2-2-1.exe" and "WTPModelClient.exe" are in the same directory. These files *must* be in the same directory for the application to run. Double-click ```WTPModelClient.exe``` to open the user interface.

### Creating a shortcut
To make it easier to run the program, you can create a shortcut to WTPModelClient.exe. To do so, right-click on "WTPModelClient.exe"
and select "Create shortcut". In the WTPModelClient folder, you should see "WTPModelClient - Shortcut". Double-clicking this
shortcut will open the user interface. This shortcut (AND ONLY THIS SHORTCUT) can be moved out of WTPModelClient folder to a
move convenient location, such as the Desktop.

## Getting started
For instructions about how to use the WTP Model, please refer to the manual. To access the manual, click the ```Help``` button while running the WTP Model application or navigate unzipped folder ```WTP-Model-CU-Boulder``` and open the manual from there.
